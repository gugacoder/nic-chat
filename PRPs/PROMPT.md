# Project Specification

This file is where you write your project requirements and specifications in natural language. Describe the features you want to build, the functionality needed, and any technical context or constraints. The content of this file will be processed by the `generate-prp` command, which will automatically analyze your specifications and create the complete PRP structure (Features, Tasks, and Domains) with proper linking and organization. Simply write what you want to build as if explaining to a developer, and the system will transform it into actionable, linked documentation ready for AI implementation.

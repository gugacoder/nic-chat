## Purpose

Knowledge Base Curation provides intelligent content management and quality assurance for the organizational knowledge repository, ensuring that information used by NIC LLM and shared with customers maintains high standards of accuracy, relevance, and utility. This feature implements automated content validation, human oversight workflows, and continuous quality improvement processes.

## Scope

- Automated content quality assessment with scoring and validation rules
- Multi-stage approval workflows for different content types and sensitivity levels
- Content lifecycle management from creation through retirement
- Duplicate detection and content consolidation to prevent fragmentation
- Source attribution and credibility tracking for all knowledge content
- Integration with vector database for optimized search and retrieval
- Analytics dashboard for content performance and usage metrics
- Automated content refresh and maintenance scheduling

## User Flow

1. Content enters system through AI generation, human contribution, or external import
2. Automated validation checks assess quality, accuracy, and formatting compliance
3. Content is classified by type, sensitivity, and required approval level
4. Approval workflow routes content to appropriate reviewers based on classification
5. Reviewers evaluate content using standardized criteria and provide feedback
6. Approved content is published to knowledge base with proper categorization
7. System monitors content usage and effectiveness through user interactions
8. Automated maintenance identifies outdated content for review or retirement
9. Performance analytics inform content strategy and improvement priorities

**Success State**: High-quality, well-organized knowledge base that consistently provides valuable information to users and AI systems

**Error Handling**: Validation failures provide specific improvement guidance, approval delays trigger notifications, and content conflicts are resolved through structured review processes

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

- **CurationEngine.py**: `backend/open_webui/services/curation/engine.py` - Content quality assessment and validation
- **WorkflowManager.py**: `backend/open_webui/services/curation/workflow.py` - Approval workflow orchestration
- **QualityValidator.py**: `backend/open_webui/services/curation/validator.py` - Automated quality checking and scoring
- **ContentDashboard.svelte**: `src/lib/components/curation/Dashboard.svelte` - Curation management interface
- **AnalyticsService.py**: `backend/open_webui/services/curation/analytics.py` - Content performance tracking

### Integration Points

- **Vector Search RAG**: Content embedding and search index management for curated content
- **GitLab Documentation Management**: Quality validation before GitLab contributions
- **Self-Managed Knowledge Loop**: Feedback integration for continuous improvement
- **Authentication System**: Role-based access control for curation workflows

### Implementation Patterns

- **Workflow Orchestration**: State machine-based approval process with configurable rules
- **Quality Scoring**: Multi-dimensional assessment with weighted criteria and ML enhancement
- **Content Versioning**: Complete version history with diff tracking and rollback capabilities
- **Performance Analytics**: Real-time metrics collection with trend analysis and alerting

## Examples

### Implementation References

- **[curation-engine-example/](Examples/curation-engine-example/)** - Complete content curation system with quality assessment
- **[workflow-manager.py](Examples/workflow-manager.py)** - Approval workflow implementation with state management
- **[quality-validator.py](Examples/quality-validator.py)** - Automated content validation with scoring algorithms
- **[curation-dashboard/](Examples/curation-dashboard/)** - Frontend interface for content management and review

## Error Scenarios

- **Quality Score Below Threshold**: Content fails automated validation → Provide specific improvement suggestions → Route to human reviewer for decision
- **Reviewer Unavailable**: Assigned reviewer not responding within SLA → Escalate to backup reviewer → Notify content owner of delay
- **Content Conflict**: Multiple versions of same content exist → Compare versions side-by-side → Facilitate consolidation decision
- **Analytics Data Loss**: Metrics collection fails → Use cached data → Regenerate metrics from available logs

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automated quality assessment provides consistent scoring with <10% variance from human assessment
- [ ] Approval workflows process content within defined SLA timeframes for each content type
- [ ] Duplicate detection identifies >95% of similar content with minimal false positives
- [ ] Content analytics provide actionable insights for knowledge base optimization
- [ ] Integration with vector search ensures curated content is immediately searchable
- [ ] Quality validation prevents publication of content below defined thresholds
- [ ] Performance metrics track content effectiveness and user satisfaction
- [ ] Workflow notifications keep stakeholders informed of review status and requirements

## Validation

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Quality assessment algorithms, workflow state management, and validation logic
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end curation workflows with mock content and reviewers
- **Performance Tests**: Content processing speed and analytics generation under load

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Test quality assessment accuracy
python -m pytest tests/test_quality_assessment.py::test_scoring_consistency

# Validate workflow state transitions
python -m pytest tests/test_workflow.py::test_approval_process

# Test duplicate detection effectiveness
python scripts/test_duplicate_detection.py --dataset test-content

# Verify analytics accuracy
python -m pytest tests/test_analytics.py::test_metrics_calculation
```

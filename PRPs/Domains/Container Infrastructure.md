## Overview

The Container Infrastructure domain defines the deployment and orchestration strategy for NIC Chat using Docker containerization. This domain encompasses container design, multi-service orchestration, volume management, networking patterns, and production deployment configurations that enable scalable and maintainable operation in enterprise environments.

## Containerization Strategy

Docker containers provide consistent deployment environments with isolated dependencies and predictable runtime behavior. The system extends Open WebUI's containerization with NIC-specific configurations and additional services for enterprise features.

Container images use multi-stage builds for optimized size and security with separate images for development and production environments. The system implements proper base image selection, security scanning, and regular updates for vulnerability management.

Service architecture separates concerns with dedicated containers for frontend, backend, database, vector database, and supporting services. This separation enables independent scaling, updates, and maintenance without affecting the entire system.

## Multi-Service Orchestration

Docker Compose orchestrates the complete NIC Chat stack with proper service dependencies, networking, and volume management. The composition includes PostgreSQL for relational data, QDrant for vector storage, and Redis for caching and session management.

Service communication uses internal Docker networks with proper service discovery and load balancing. The system implements health checks, restart policies, and graceful shutdown procedures for reliable operation.

Environment configuration supports multiple deployment scenarios including development, testing, and production with appropriate security settings and resource allocation for each environment.

## Volume and Data Management

Persistent storage uses Docker volumes for data durability across container restarts and updates. The system separates application data, database storage, and configuration files with appropriate backup and recovery strategies.

Volume mounting strategies support both bind mounts for development and named volumes for production with proper permission management and security considerations.

Data lifecycle management includes backup procedures, data migration strategies, and disaster recovery planning for production deployments.

## Network Configuration

Network architecture implements proper isolation between services with defined communication paths and security boundaries. The system uses custom Docker networks for internal communication while exposing only necessary ports to external access.

Load balancing and reverse proxy configuration enables high availability and scalability with proper SSL termination and request routing. The system supports both single-instance and multi-instance deployments.

Security implementation includes proper firewall rules, network segmentation, and encrypted communication between services where required.

## Production Deployment Patterns

Production configurations include resource limits, security contexts, and monitoring integration for enterprise-grade operation. The system implements proper secrets management with encrypted storage and rotation capabilities.

Scaling strategies support both vertical and horizontal scaling with configuration for resource allocation and service replication. The system provides guidance for capacity planning and performance optimization.

Update and maintenance procedures include rolling updates, database migrations, and backup verification with minimal downtime strategies for production environments.

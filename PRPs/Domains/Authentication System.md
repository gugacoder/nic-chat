## Overview

The Authentication System domain defines the comprehensive security framework for NIC Chat, implementing a hybrid approach that supports both administrative root password access and corporate LDAP integration. This domain ensures secure user identity management, session handling, and role-based access control while maintaining compatibility with existing enterprise authentication infrastructure.

## Hybrid Authentication Model

The system implements a dual authentication strategy designed for enterprise flexibility. Root password authentication provides administrative access for system configuration and emergency operations, while LDAP integration enables seamless corporate user authentication through existing directory services.

Authentication flows support multiple scenarios including initial system setup, regular user access, and administrative operations. The system maintains separate authentication paths while sharing common session management and authorization mechanisms.

Token-based authentication using JWT ensures stateless session management with configurable expiration policies. The system supports automatic token refresh, secure storage patterns, and graceful handling of authentication failures.

## LDAP Integration Architecture

LDAP integration connects with corporate directory services to authenticate users against existing organizational accounts. The system supports multiple LDAP configurations including Active Directory, OpenLDAP, and other directory service implementations.

User attribute mapping extracts relevant information from LDAP entries including display names, email addresses, group memberships, and organizational units. This information populates user profiles and determines initial role assignments within the NIC Chat system.

The LDAP client implements connection pooling, failover mechanisms, and secure communication protocols. Configuration management allows runtime updates to LDAP settings without system restarts.

## Role-Based Access Control

The authorization system implements granular role-based access control with predefined roles for different user types. Administrative roles provide system configuration access, content management permissions, and user administration capabilities.

Regular user roles support standard chat functionality, document access, and tool execution within defined boundaries. The system supports custom role creation and permission assignment for organizational-specific requirements.

Permission enforcement occurs at multiple levels including API endpoints, database operations, and feature access. The system maintains audit logs for authentication events and authorization decisions.

## Session Management Patterns

Session management implements secure token handling with configurable lifetime policies and automatic refresh mechanisms. The system supports concurrent sessions with proper isolation and conflict resolution.

Security features include session invalidation, suspicious activity detection, and automatic logout policies. The system maintains session state consistency across multiple browser tabs and device types.

Integration with frontend authentication flows ensures seamless user experiences while maintaining security requirements. The system handles authentication state synchronization and provides clear feedback for authentication errors.

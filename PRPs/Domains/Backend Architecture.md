## Overview

The Backend Architecture domain defines the server-side infrastructure of NIC Chat, built on FastAPI framework with Python. This domain encompasses API design, data processing pipelines, authentication systems, and integration patterns with external services. It provides the foundation for all AI interactions, knowledge management operations, and enterprise integrations that power the NIC Chat platform.

## API Framework Design

The backend leverages FastAPI for high-performance API development with automatic OpenAPI documentation, request validation, and dependency injection. The architecture follows RESTful principles for standard operations while implementing WebSocket endpoints for real-time features like streaming chat responses and live collaboration.

Router organization separates concerns by feature domains - authentication, chat management, file operations, knowledge retrieval, and administrative functions. Each router implements consistent error handling, logging, and security middleware. The framework supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations for optimal performance under varying load conditions.

Database integration uses SQLAlchemy ORM with Alembic migrations for schema evolution. The backend implements connection pooling, query optimization, and transaction management to ensure data consistency and performance at scale.

## Service Integration Patterns

The backend orchestrates multiple external services to deliver comprehensive AI capabilities. Integration with the NIC LLM follows OpenAI-compatible protocols while maintaining configuration flexibility for model parameters and endpoint management.

QDrant vector database integration enables semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows. The backend manages document embedding, vector storage, and similarity search operations through optimized query patterns and caching strategies.

GitLab integration provides automated documentation management through webhook listeners, API clients, and merge request automation. The backend maintains synchronization between internal knowledge bases and external documentation repositories.

## Security and Authentication Architecture

Security implementation follows enterprise standards with multi-layered authentication options. The hybrid authentication system supports both root password access for administrative functions and LDAP integration for corporate user management.

Session management includes JWT token handling, automatic refresh cycles, and secure storage patterns. The backend implements role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions for different user types and administrative functions.

All API endpoints include proper authorization checks, input validation, and rate limiting. Security middleware handles CORS policies, security headers, and request sanitization to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

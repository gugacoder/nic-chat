## Overview

The AI Integration Patterns domain defines the comprehensive integration strategy with the NIC LLM, establishing communication protocols, request handling patterns, and response processing workflows. This domain encompasses OpenAI-compatible API integration, streaming response handling, context management, and intelligent prompt engineering that enables sophisticated AI-human collaboration within the corporate environment.

## OpenAI-Compatible Integration

The system integrates with NIC LLM through OpenAI-compatible API endpoints, ensuring compatibility with existing tools and frameworks while maintaining flexibility for proprietary model features. The integration supports standard chat completion APIs with extended parameters for NIC-specific capabilities.

API client implementation includes proper authentication, rate limiting, and error handling with automatic retry logic and fallback mechanisms. The system maintains connection pooling and persistent connections for optimal performance.

Model configuration management enables runtime adjustment of parameters including temperature, context length, and response formats. The system supports model switching and A/B testing for optimization of different use cases.

## Streaming Response Architecture

Real-time response streaming provides immediate feedback to users with proper buffering and chunk processing. The system implements WebSocket communication for bi-directional streaming with proper error handling and connection recovery.

Stream processing includes partial response handling, progress indicators, and cancellation mechanisms for long-running requests. The system maintains response integrity with proper chunk ordering and error detection.

Integration with frontend components enables real-time UI updates with smooth typing animations and immediate user feedback. The system handles network interruptions gracefully with automatic reconnection and state synchronization.

## Context Management Patterns

Conversation context management maintains relevant history and retrieval-augmented content within token limits. The system implements intelligent context pruning with priority-based selection and summarization techniques.

Context assembly combines user messages, system instructions, retrieved documents, and tool outputs into coherent prompts. The system implements template-based prompt generation with dynamic content insertion and validation.

Memory management includes conversation state persistence, context caching, and efficient context window utilization. The system provides debugging tools for context inspection and optimization.

## Prompt Engineering Framework

Systematic prompt engineering ensures consistent and effective AI interactions across different use cases. The system maintains a library of proven prompt templates with versioning and performance tracking.

Dynamic prompt generation adapts to user context, conversation history, and available tools with proper prompt validation and optimization. The system implements prompt testing frameworks for quality assurance and performance measurement.

Integration with domain expertise enables specialized prompts for different business functions including documentation, code generation, analysis, and creative content creation.

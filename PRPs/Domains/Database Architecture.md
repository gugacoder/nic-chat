## Overview

The Database Architecture domain defines the persistent data management strategy for NIC Chat, built on PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM. This domain encompasses data modeling, transaction management, migration strategies, and performance optimization patterns for storing conversations, user data, system configurations, and application state across the entire platform.

## Relational Data Model

The database schema extends the Open WebUI foundation with NIC-specific enhancements for enterprise features. Core entities include users, conversations, messages, files, and system configurations with well-defined relationships and constraints.

User management tables support both local authentication and LDAP integration with profile information, role assignments, and preference storage. Conversation tables maintain chat history with message threading, tool execution results, and metadata for search and retrieval operations.

File management entities track document uploads, processing status, and vector embeddings with relationships to conversations and knowledge base entries. Configuration tables store system settings, model parameters, and integration credentials with proper encryption for sensitive data.

## Transaction Management Patterns

Database operations implement consistent transaction boundaries with proper isolation levels for concurrent access. The system uses SQLAlchemy's session management for automatic transaction handling and rollback capabilities on errors.

Long-running operations like document processing and vector embedding generation use database-backed job queues with status tracking and retry mechanisms. This ensures system reliability and provides visibility into background processing operations.

Connection pooling optimizes database resource utilization with configurable pool sizes and timeout settings. The system implements proper connection lifecycle management with health checks and automatic recovery from connection failures.

## Migration and Schema Evolution

Database schema management uses Alembic migrations for version-controlled schema changes and data migrations. The migration system supports both forward and backward migrations with proper dependency tracking and rollback capabilities.

Schema changes are organized by feature domains with clear naming conventions and documentation. The system supports both online and offline migrations depending on the complexity and impact of schema changes.

Data integrity is maintained through foreign key constraints, check constraints, and custom validation logic. The migration system includes data validation steps to ensure consistency during schema evolution.

## Performance Optimization

Query optimization includes proper indexing strategies for frequently accessed data patterns including conversation lookups, message searches, and user authentication queries. The system implements query analysis and performance monitoring to identify optimization opportunities.

Caching strategies reduce database load for frequently accessed data including user profiles, system configurations, and recent conversation data. The system uses Redis for distributed caching with proper cache invalidation and consistency management.

Database maintenance includes automated tasks for data cleanup, statistics updates, and performance monitoring. The system provides metrics and alerts for database health monitoring and capacity planning.

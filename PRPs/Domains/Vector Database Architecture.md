## Overview

The Vector Database Architecture domain defines the semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) infrastructure for NIC Chat, built on QDrant vector database. This domain encompasses document embedding strategies, similarity search algorithms, and intelligent content retrieval patterns that enable the AI to access and utilize organizational knowledge effectively during conversations.

## Vector Storage Design

QDrant serves as the primary vector database for storing document embeddings, conversation context, and knowledge base representations. The system organizes vectors into collections based on content type, access patterns, and security requirements.

Document embeddings are generated using consistent embedding models to ensure compatibility and search accuracy. The system maintains metadata alongside vectors including source references, timestamps, access permissions, and content classifications.

Collection management implements proper indexing strategies for fast similarity search with configurable distance metrics and search parameters. The system supports both dense and sparse vector representations depending on content characteristics and use case requirements.

## Embedding Generation Pipeline

Document processing pipeline converts various content types into vector representations through a multi-stage process. Text extraction handles multiple formats including PDFs, office documents, markdown files, and web content.

Chunking strategies segment long documents into optimal pieces for embedding generation while maintaining semantic coherence. The system implements overlapping windows and hierarchical chunking to preserve context across document boundaries.

Embedding models are configurable with support for multiple providers and model types. The system caches embeddings to avoid reprocessing and implements incremental updates for document changes.

## Semantic Search Implementation

Search functionality implements hybrid approaches combining vector similarity with traditional text search for optimal recall and precision. The system supports complex queries with filters, date ranges, and permission-based access control.

Query processing includes query expansion, embedding generation, and result ranking with configurable relevance thresholds. The system implements result deduplication and content summarization for improved user experience.

Search results include proper attribution with source references, confidence scores, and snippet generation. The system maintains search analytics for query optimization and content gap identification.

## RAG Integration Patterns

Retrieval-augmented generation workflows integrate seamlessly with NIC LLM interactions to provide contextual information during conversations. The system implements intelligent context selection based on conversation history and query relevance.

Context assembly combines retrieved documents with conversation state to create comprehensive prompts for the language model. The system manages context window limitations through intelligent summarization and prioritization.

Feedback loops capture user interactions and model responses to improve retrieval quality over time. The system maintains metrics on retrieval accuracy and user satisfaction for continuous optimization.

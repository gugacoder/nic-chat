## Context

LDAP authentication integration enables NIC Chat to seamlessly authenticate corporate users against existing directory services while maintaining the flexibility of root password access for administrative operations. This task is critical for enterprise deployment as it eliminates the need for separate user account management and leverages existing organizational identity infrastructure.

## Relationships

### Implements Feature

- **[[Hybrid Authentication.md]]**: Provides the LDAP component of the dual authentication system that enables corporate user integration

### Impacts Domains

- **[[Authentication System.md]]**: Implements the primary authentication patterns for enterprise user management and directory integration
- **[[Database Architecture.md]]**: Integrates with user data models for profile synchronization and role management

## Implementation

### Required Actions

1. Implement LDAP client with support for Active Directory, OpenLDAP, and other directory services
2. Create user attribute mapping system for profile synchronization from LDAP to local database
3. Implement group-based role mapping to translate LDAP groups into NIC Chat permissions
4. Create connection pooling and failover mechanisms for reliable LDAP service integration
5. Implement secure credential handling and encrypted communication with directory services
6. Create user provisioning workflow that automatically creates accounts on first LDAP login

### Files to Modify/Create

- **Create**: `backend/open_webui/services/auth/ldap_client.py` - LDAP client implementation with connection management
- **Create**: `backend/open_webui/services/auth/ldap_sync.py` - User synchronization and attribute mapping service
- **Create**: `backend/open_webui/config/ldap_config.py` - LDAP configuration management and validation
- **Create**: `backend/open_webui/services/auth/role_mapper.py` - LDAP group to role mapping service
- **Modify**: `backend/open_webui/routers/auths.py` - Extend authentication router with LDAP login support
- **Modify**: `backend/open_webui/models/users.py` - Add LDAP-specific user attributes and metadata

### Key Implementation Details

- Support multiple LDAP authentication methods including simple bind and SASL
- Implement secure connection handling with TLS encryption and certificate validation
- Create comprehensive error handling for network issues, authentication failures, and service unavailability
- Include caching mechanisms for LDAP queries to improve performance and reduce directory server load
- Implement proper LDAP injection prevention and input validation for security

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] LDAP client successfully authenticates users against configured directory services
- [ ] User attribute mapping correctly synchronizes profile information from LDAP to local database
- [ ] Group-based role mapping translates LDAP group memberships into appropriate system permissions
- [ ] Connection pooling maintains optimal performance under varying authentication load
- [ ] Failover mechanisms provide graceful degradation when LDAP services are unavailable
- [ ] Security implementation prevents LDAP injection attacks and protects credential information
- [ ] User provisioning automatically creates accounts for new LDAP users on first login
- [ ] Integration supports multiple LDAP server configurations for complex organizational structures

## Validation

### Verification Steps

1. Test LDAP authentication with valid and invalid user credentials to verify security implementation
2. Validate user attribute mapping by comparing LDAP attributes with synchronized local profiles
3. Verify group-based role mapping by testing users with different LDAP group memberships
4. Test connection failover by simulating LDAP server unavailability and verifying graceful degradation
5. Validate security measures by attempting LDAP injection attacks and verifying prevention

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Test LDAP authentication and user validation
python -m pytest tests/test_ldap_auth.py::test_user_authentication

# Validate attribute mapping and profile synchronization
python -m pytest tests/test_ldap_sync.py::test_attribute_mapping

# Test role mapping and permission assignment
python -m pytest tests/test_role_mapper.py::test_group_permissions

# Test connection handling and failover mechanisms
python -m pytest tests/test_ldap_client.py::test_connection_failover

# Validate security measures and injection prevention
python -m pytest tests/test_ldap_security.py::test_injection_prevention
```

### Success Indicators

- LDAP authentication succeeds for valid users within 2 seconds under normal conditions
- User attribute synchronization maintains >99% accuracy compared to LDAP source data
- Role mapping correctly assigns permissions for 100% of configured group memberships
- Connection failover maintains service availability during directory service interruptions
- Security validation prevents 100% of attempted LDAP injection attacks with proper logging

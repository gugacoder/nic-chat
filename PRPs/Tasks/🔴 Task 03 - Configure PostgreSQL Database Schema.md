## Context

The PostgreSQL database schema configuration extends the existing Open WebUI foundation to support NIC-specific enterprise features including enhanced user management, conversation persistence, tool execution tracking, and system monitoring. This task is critical as it provides the data persistence layer for all user interactions, authentication sessions, and business process automation results.

## Relationships

### Implements Feature

- **[[Conversation Persistence.md]]**: Provides the relational database foundation for storing chat history, user sessions, and conversation metadata

### Impacts Domains

- **[[Database Architecture.md]]**: Establishes the extended data model and schema patterns for enterprise features
- **[[Authentication System.md]]**: Supports user account management and session persistence requirements

## Implementation

### Required Actions

1. Extend existing Open WebUI schema with NIC-specific tables for enhanced functionality
2. Create user management tables supporting both local authentication and LDAP integration
3. Implement conversation and message tables with enhanced metadata for tool execution results
4. Create audit logging tables for comprehensive security and compliance tracking
5. Establish database indexes and constraints for optimal performance and data integrity
6. Create Alembic migration scripts for schema deployment and version management

### Files to Modify/Create

- **Create**: `backend/open_webui/migrations/versions/001_nic_extensions.py` - Database migration for NIC-specific schema extensions
- **Create**: `backend/open_webui/models/nic_users.py` - Enhanced user model with LDAP integration support
- **Create**: `backend/open_webui/models/tool_executions.py` - Tool execution tracking and audit models
- **Create**: `backend/open_webui/models/audit_logs.py` - Comprehensive audit logging model
- **Modify**: `backend/open_webui/models/chats.py` - Extend conversation model with enhanced metadata
- **Modify**: `backend/open_webui/models/messages.py` - Extend message model for tool execution integration

### Key Implementation Details

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing Open WebUI schema and data
- Implement proper foreign key relationships and referential integrity constraints
- Create appropriate database indexes for frequently queried columns and search patterns
- Use PostgreSQL-specific features like JSONB columns for flexible metadata storage
- Include data validation constraints and check constraints for data quality enforcement

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Database migration successfully applies NIC extensions without affecting existing data
- [ ] Enhanced user model supports both local authentication and LDAP integration attributes
- [ ] Conversation and message tables store tool execution results with proper metadata
- [ ] Audit logging captures all security events and user actions with complete traceability
- [ ] Database performance supports expected user load with optimal query response times
- [ ] Data integrity constraints prevent invalid data states and maintain consistency
- [ ] Schema documentation provides clear guidance for future development and maintenance
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures work correctly with extended schema structure

## Validation

### Verification Steps

1. Execute database migration on test environment and verify all tables created correctly
2. Test user authentication flows with both local and LDAP integration scenarios
3. Validate conversation persistence by creating and retrieving chat history with tool results
4. Verify audit logging by performing various user actions and examining log completeness
5. Run performance tests to ensure query response times meet requirements under load

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Run database migration and verify schema creation
alembic upgrade head && python scripts/verify_schema.py

# Test user model functionality with authentication scenarios
python -m pytest tests/test_nic_users.py::test_ldap_integration

# Validate conversation persistence and tool execution tracking
python -m pytest tests/test_conversation_persistence.py::test_tool_results

# Test audit logging completeness and accuracy
python -m pytest tests/test_audit_logs.py::test_security_events

# Run database performance tests under realistic load
python scripts/test_db_performance.py --users 1000 --conversations 10000
```

### Success Indicators

- Database migration completes without errors and all tables pass validation checks
- User authentication supports both local and LDAP scenarios with proper attribute mapping
- Conversation persistence maintains complete chat history with tool execution context
- Audit logging captures 100% of security events with sufficient detail for compliance
- Database queries respond within 100ms for typical operations under expected load

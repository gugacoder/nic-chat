## Context

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) foundation provides the core infrastructure for enabling NIC LLM to interact with corporate tools and systems. This task establishes the protocol handler, message processing framework, and security boundaries that transform NIC Chat from a conversational interface into an active automation platform. The MCP foundation is critical as it enables all tool-based workflows and business process automation features.

## Relationships

### Implements Feature

- **[[MCP Tools System.md]]**: Provides the foundational protocol implementation that enables all tool discovery, execution, and result processing capabilities

### Impacts Domains

- **[[MCP Tools Architecture.md]]**: Establishes the core protocol patterns and communication frameworks for tool integration
- **[[Backend Architecture.md]]**: Extends service architecture with specialized tool orchestration capabilities

## Implementation

### Required Actions

1. Implement core MCP protocol message handler with request/response/notification processing
2. Establish WebSocket communication infrastructure for real-time tool execution monitoring
3. Create security framework with sandbox isolation and permission validation boundaries
4. Implement tool capability negotiation and discovery protocols according to MCP specification
5. Create audit logging and monitoring infrastructure for all tool interactions and security events

### Files to Modify/Create

- **Create**: `backend/open_webui/services/mcp/protocol.py` - Core MCP protocol implementation and message handling
- **Create**: `backend/open_webui/services/mcp/websocket.py` - WebSocket handler for real-time tool communication
- **Create**: `backend/open_webui/services/mcp/security.py` - Security framework and permission validation
- **Create**: `backend/open_webui/models/mcp_models.py` - MCP data models and message structures
- **Create**: `backend/open_webui/routers/mcp.py` - MCP API endpoints and request routing
- **Modify**: `backend/open_webui/main.py` - Initialize MCP services during application startup

### Key Implementation Details

- Follow MCP specification exactly for protocol compatibility and tool interoperability
- Implement message validation and schema enforcement for all protocol communications
- Create containerized execution environment for tool isolation and security
- Support both streaming and batch tool execution with appropriate progress tracking
- Include comprehensive error handling with detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MCP protocol handler correctly processes request, response, and notification message types
- [ ] WebSocket communication enables real-time bidirectional messaging for tool execution
- [ ] Security framework enforces sandbox isolation and prevents unauthorized system access
- [ ] Capability negotiation successfully identifies and registers available tool capabilities
- [ ] Message validation ensures protocol compliance and prevents malformed communications
- [ ] Audit logging captures complete interaction history with sufficient detail for security monitoring
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback for protocol violations and communication failures
- [ ] Performance supports concurrent tool operations without resource conflicts or deadlocks

## Validation

### Verification Steps

1. Test MCP message processing with valid and invalid protocol messages to verify compliance
2. Validate WebSocket communication with real-time tool execution scenarios
3. Verify security isolation by attempting unauthorized operations within sandbox environment
4. Test capability negotiation with multiple tool types and complex capability sets
5. Confirm audit logging completeness by examining logs after various tool interaction scenarios

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Test MCP protocol message handling and validation
python -m pytest tests/test_mcp_protocol.py::test_message_processing

# Validate WebSocket communication and real-time features
python -m pytest tests/test_mcp_websocket.py::test_realtime_communication

# Test security framework and sandbox isolation
python -m pytest tests/test_mcp_security.py::test_sandbox_isolation

# Verify capability negotiation protocols
python -m pytest tests/test_mcp_protocol.py::test_capability_negotiation

# Test audit logging and monitoring capabilities
python -m pytest tests/test_mcp_audit.py::test_complete_logging
```

### Success Indicators

- Protocol handler processes 100% of valid MCP messages according to specification
- WebSocket connections maintain stable communication with <1% message loss
- Security framework prevents 100% of unauthorized access attempts with proper logging
- Capability negotiation completes within 5 seconds for typical tool sets
- Audit logs capture all tool interactions with complete parameter and result information
